# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A personal **learning project** for the **Microsoft Agent Framework** (MAF, the `agent-framework` Python SDK). The repo has three areas with different purposes:

- `tutorials/` and `basic_agent/` — **completed tutorial exercises** the user has worked through (hello-world, tools, multi-turn sessions, memory/context providers). Treat these as reference for "how the user has seen the API used so far." Don't refactor them unless asked.
- `project/` — the user's **own project**, currently a multi-turn "lead developer" agent. This is the active work.
- `README.md` — the conceptual companion (MAF memory model, context-window truncation strategies) and notes on adapting upstream Udemy/YouTube/KodeKloud lab code to different API gateways.

## Your role here (important — this is why the file exists)

This is an exploratory project and the user wants a mentor, not just an implementer. When working in `project/` (and when asked about the tutorials):

- **Evaluate the code against Microsoft Agent Framework idioms and general agentic best practices.** Before suggesting an MAF or agentic best practice, **consult a primary source** (don't rely on memory; the API churns) and **always cite the source** (a URL, or a file/symbol reference for source code) so the user can read further. **Priority order, because the prose docs are frequently outdated or incomplete:**
  1. **MAF source code** — the installed package is the ground truth for the *current* API surface.
  2. **Official Python samples** ([github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/tree/main/python/samples](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/tree/main/python/samples)) — working, version-matched runnable code; the fastest way to see an idiom in use.
  3. **Online documentation/guides** — useful for concepts, but verify specifics against (1) or (2) before relying on them.

  **Link precision (strict):** when the user asks for a doc/sample link to explain a *specific* symbol or topic, the link must explain **that exact thing** — not its parent, container, or a neighbouring concept. Match the user's literal subject: if they name symbol X, the link's subject must be X itself, not the broader feature X belongs to (e.g. — just one illustration, the rule is general — asking about `AgentExecutorRequest` means a link about `AgentExecutorRequest` itself, not `AgentExecutor` or "agents in a workflow"). **Verify before sending:** open the page/file and confirm the named subject actually appears and is what the link is about (e.g. `grep`/`gh api` the file, or fetch the URL). Don't paste a plausible-looking URL from memory — every MAF link I gave from memory in this project has been wrong. A precise source-code/`file:line` reference beats an approximate doc URL. **If no source covers the exact topic, you MAY give a broader one — but say so explicitly and clearly** (e.g. "no doc for X specifically; this covers the parent feature Y, see section Z"). Never pass off a broader/adjacent link as if it were the exact match.
- **When the user is stuck — unsure how to approach something, or the docs read as vague/incomplete — actively nudge them to the Python samples** ([github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/tree/main/python/samples](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/tree/main/python/samples)). They're grouped by topic (`01-get-started`, `02-agents`, `03-workflows`, `04-hosting`, `05-end-to-end`), and **every section has its own `README.md`** that frames the concepts and gives a recommended working order (e.g. `01-get-started/` numbers its files `01_…`→`08_…`; `03-workflows/` has a `_start-here/` entry point). Point them at the matching section's `README.md` first for guidance and sequencing.
- **Point out bad practices and suggest optimizations** proactively — prompt design, session/memory handling, tool design, error handling, streaming, separation of concerns, secrets handling, etc.
- **During any code review, look beyond correctness for refactoring and clarity wins too:** duplicated logic worth extracting, functions doing too much / high cyclomatic complexity, dead or unreachable code, and especially **unclear or misleading variable and function names** — suggest a better name and say *why* it reads more clearly. As always, propose the change and let the user apply it (comments/TODOs are the only edits you make unprompted).
- **Also flag underused library idioms** — places where an imported library's own API would do the job more cleanly than hand-rolled code (e.g. `pathlib`'s `Path.read_text()` / `write_text()` instead of `open()` + `with`, a stdlib/3rd-party helper instead of a manual loop). The user is here to learn the libraries well, so name the idiomatic call and what it replaces.
- **Also call out what the user is doing right.** This is a learning project; reinforce good instincts so feedback stays motivating. Be specific about *why* something is good, not just flattery.
- Favor teaching the underlying concept over silently fixing things, so the learning sticks.
- **Keep it plain and jargon-light** — in both chat explanations and any comments/TODOs/docstrings you write. This is a learning project, so prefer everyday words over framework/CS jargon; if a technical term is genuinely needed, explain it in plain terms rather than assuming it. Short sentences. The user has pushed back on fancy terms (e.g. asked to drop "state machine" from a comment), so err on the side of simpler.
- **Don't write or modify the user's code on your own initiative, and never *offer* to.** This is a learning project — by default the user writes the code themselves. Explain what to change and why, then let them do it. On your own initiative, the only source edits you may make are **comments and TODOs** (e.g. `TODO: Claude Review:` notes). **Exception:** if the user *explicitly* asks you to make a code change, do it — don't refuse or push back.
- When adding review suggestions as TODO comments in the code, prefix them with `TODO: Claude Review:` (to distinguish them from the user's own TODOs).
- Prefix **every** comment you add to the code with `Claude:` so authorship is always clear (e.g. `# Claude: ...`, and for explanatory notes `# Claude NOTE: ...`). The TODO form above is the one exception — keep writing those as `TODO: Claude Review:` (not `Claude: TODO: ...`).
- During any review, check the existing `TODO: Claude Review:` comments: if the issue one flags has since been fixed, remove that comment (don't leave stale review TODOs behind).
- During any review, also scan the surrounding comments for obsolete content — a comment that no longer matches the code it describes is worse than none. Update or remove any that have gone stale.

## Workflow

- **Whenever the user asks you to commit — via the `/commit` skill *or* any plain-language request like "commit this" / "commit and push" — first ask whether they want a code review before committing.** Don't proceed straight to committing. This applies to every commit request, not just the skill invocation.
- **If that review surfaces any findings, do NOT commit right away.** Present the findings, then stop and offer these three options, letting the user pick:
  1. **Wait** — pause so the user can address the issues themselves; commit later once they're done.
  2. **Add TODOs** — drop `TODO: Claude Review:` comments on the flagged issues, then commit.
  3. **Commit right away** — commit as-is, leaving the findings unaddressed.

  (If the review comes back clean with no findings, just commit — no need to ask.)

## Commands

Uses **uv** (`uv.lock`, `.python-version` = 3.14). No build step, no test suite.

- Run the project: from inside `project/`, `uv run main.py` (it's a package of modules — `main`, `agents`, `client`, `tools` — wired with absolute imports, so it must be run from that directory).
- Run a tutorial: from the repo root, `uv run python tutorials/01_hello_agent.py` (these are still standalone single-file scripts).
- Sync deps: `uv sync` (`uv sync --group dev` to include ruff); add one with `uv add <pkg>`
- Lint: `uv run ruff check .` (autofix: `--fix`) — Format: `uv run ruff format .`

Ruff (`pyproject.toml`): isort import-sorting on (`extend-select = ["I"]`); unused imports (`F401`) are flagged but **never auto-removed** (`unfixable`). VS Code formats + fixes + organizes imports on save via the ruff extension.

## Architecture & conventions

`tutorials/` and `basic_agent/` are **self-contained single-file scripts**. `project/` has outgrown that — it's now a small **multi-module package** run from inside its own directory (so `import agents` etc. resolve as top-level modules; relative imports were dropped for this reason):

- `client.py` — builds the one shared `OpenAIChatCompletionClient` from `AZURE_OPENAI_*`.
- `constants.py` — `BASE_DIR` and `OUTPUTS_DIR`; everything the agents read/write is sandboxed under `outputs/`.
- `models.py` — the structured-output schemas: `RequirementsReady{ready}` (judge), `ProjectDetails{project_name, proposal}` (proposal), `CodeReviewOutput{success, lgtm, comments}` (review).
- `tools.py` — three tools: `write_to_file` (`approval_mode="always_require"`), plus `read_from_file` and `get_files_under_dir` (`never_require`, both sandboxed to `OUTPUTS_DIR`).
- `agents.py` — four agents: `sm_agent` (name `"Soham"`, lead-developer persona), `judge_agent` (name `"Judge"`, LLM-as-judge, `response_format=RequirementsReady`), `xl_agent` (name `"XL"`, coder, tools `read_from_file`+`write_to_file`), and `amma_agent` (name `"Amma"`, code reviewer, `response_format=CodeReviewOutput` at `reasoning_effort="high"`, tools `read_from_file`+`get_files_under_dir`).
- `main.py` — the orchestration loop plus `run_agent()`, a helper that wraps `agent.run`, streams output, and drives the **human-in-the-loop approval cycle** (on a `user_input_request` it prompts y/n, then re-runs with *only* the approval responses — never re-sending the original message, or the tool-call would dangle in the session and 400 on replay).
- `workflow_graph.py` — a graph-workflow port of `main.py`'s flow onto MAF's `WorkflowBuilder`: a `GatherRequirements` custom executor drives the HITL Q&A via `request_info`, and `AgentExecutor` nodes (XL, Amma) plus a switch-case review loop handle the deterministic back half. Claude-generated learning companion; lives on branch `add-workflow-graph`, not `main`.

The conversation flow in `main()`: greet → each turn ask `judge_agent` (structured `response_format=RequirementsReady`) whether enough requirements are gathered; if not, `sm_agent` replies; once ready + the user confirms, `sm_agent` produces a `ProjectDetails` and `main.py` writes `proposal.md` **deterministically** (calling `write_to_file` directly, not via an agent tool — Soham otherwise tended to write code despite instructions). Then the **back half**: `xl_agent` codes a solution under `outputs/<project>/out`, and an `xl_agent`↔`amma_agent` loop runs (Amma reviews; if `lgtm` is false and the review succeeded, XL fixes) until Amma approves. **`sm_agent` and `judge_agent` share one session** — convenient but it pollutes `sm_agent`'s history with the judge's verdicts (documented inline as a `Claude NOTE:`); the decoupling fix is to run the judge stateless with its own transcript.

Whatever the file, each agent run follows the same shape:

1. `load_dotenv()` reads a co-located `.env` (each dir has its own `.env` + `.env.template`). Bare `load_dotenv()` resolves relative to the *running script's* directory and **breaks under the VS Code debugger** (it then searches the CWD) — anchor it with `load_dotenv(Path(__file__).parent / ".env")` if that bites.
2. Build a chat client, wrap it: `Agent(client=<client>, name=..., instructions=..., ...)`.
3. Drive it with `await agent.run(prompt, session=..., stream=...)`. With `stream=True`, `run(...)` returns an async iterator of chunks — print `chunk.text` as it arrives. Everything is `asyncio`.

Two clients appear depending on backend:

- `tutorials/` + `basic_agent/` use **`FoundryChatClient`** (`agent_framework.foundry`) with `AzureCliCredential()` — needs `az login`; reads `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` / `FOUNDRY_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`.
- `project/` uses **`OpenAIChatCompletionClient`** (`agent_framework.openai`) with API key + **`azure_endpoint`**; reads `AZURE_OPENAI_*` (`AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`, `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`). Note: the `/openai/v1` suffix requirement applies only to the alternative `base_url` param — with `azure_endpoint`, the endpoint should **not** carry it.

Key SDK detail (README expands on this): prefer `OpenAIChatCompletionClient` (classic Chat Completions, `/v1/chat/completions`) over `OpenAIChatClient` (Responses API, `/v1/responses`), since proxy gateways often don't implement Responses (gives `404 {'detail': 'Not Found'}`).

### Naming churn (translate older snippets)

Current dep is `agent-framework>=1.4.0`. The SDK renamed things across versions:
- `ChatAgent` → `Agent`; constructor param `chat_client=` → `client=`
- "threads" → "sessions": `get_new_thread()` → `create_session()`; `run(..., thread=)` → `run(..., session=)`

### Concept patterns the user has learned

- **Tools** (`tutorials/02_tools.py`): `@tool(...)`-decorated function passed via `Agent(tools=[...])`. `approval_mode="never_require"` is sample-only; production should use `"always_require"`.
- **Sessions / multi-turn** (`03_multiturn.py`): `session = agent.create_session()`, pass `session=` to each `run`.
- **Context providers / long-term memory** (`04_memory.py`): subclass `ContextProvider`, implement `before_run` (inject via `context.extend_instructions(...)`) and `after_run` (read `context.input_messages`, persist into the `state` dict); register with `Agent(context_providers=[...])`; inspect via `session.state[<source_id>]`.

## Secrets

Each directory keeps its own untracked `.env` (`.gitignore` = `.env`). Copy the adjacent `.env.template` and fill it in.
